# Color Blocks

(a.k.a, I'm really far too lazy to think of any decent name.)

Yet another common game you'd find at almost all Flash-game sites. I created
this mini-game to test the grid helper library I am working on. I'm not yet quite
done with the grid library but for a proof-of-concept, I'm quite satisfied with
this.
