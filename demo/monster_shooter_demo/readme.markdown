# Monster Shooter

(a.k.a, the first "test" of this framework.)

Just a simple game, with a simple set of rules it's virtually impossible to lose.
Keep shooting (with the `enter`) key. One monster is equivalent to one point.
Get hit by a monster and it will cost you one point (deduct one to current score).
You lose when your score becomes less than zero. And oh, move using the up and
down keys.

If you look at the code, this is a very simple version of what I originally had
in mind; maybe, some other time, for some other iteration of PyGame Objects. If
you look at my commit history, yes, this was supposed to be a clone of Plants vs
Zombies, but it ended up as a simple shoot-em-up.
