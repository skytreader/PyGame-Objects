"""
Classes in core encapsulate what happens in a game loop. It contains
the classes used to implement an MVC pattern.

Usage
  (1) Set the configuration of your game by creating a GameConfig
      instance.
  (2) Create a GameScreen instance.
  (3) Create a GameLoopEvents object by passing your GameConfig
      instance and GameScreen instance.
  (4) Create a GameLoop object by passing your GameLoopEvents object.
      Call go() .
  (5) Have fun!
